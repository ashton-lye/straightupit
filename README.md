# straightupit - Hamilton City Libraries Computer Mentorship Program Project

This project was completed as a group project in late 2018 as part of the Information Systems Development paper. In this paper, we were tasked with finding a local business or organisation who had an IT problem, and create a system or solution to solve their problem. One of our team members works part-time at Hamilton City Library as a computer mentor, and noted that the system the library used to keep track of mentoring sessions was in desperate need of an upgrade. We created this system in collaboration with the library to streamline the process and lighten the workload of the library staff.

The Computer Mentoring Program the library runs allows members of the public (clients) to come into the library and get help from a volunteer computer mentor with any computer related tasks - this could be anything from learning how to send an email, make a skype call or post on facebook to setting up a new phone or laptop. 
Under the old system, clients would have to call the library on the phone and book a session with the library staff. 
Library staff would the record the information in a spreadsheet which was only accessible to them. 
Once the session had been completed, the Mentor would record notes in a seperate spreadsheet which was only accessible to them. 
This lead to a lot of crossed wires and inconsistencies in the data, not to mention poor security. 
Our main priorities when creating the updated system were consistency of data, ease of use, and better security. 
Unfortunately, due to time constraints and other commitments, the project was not 100% finished. However, the group still earned an A+ grade for the project and the paper overall.  

The group consisted of 6 team members:  
 - Ashton Lye, who worked on the booking and login pages as well as the SQL scripting and management of the git repository.  
 - Allan Moorhouse, who worked on the statistics and login pages, css headers and footers as well as the site wide nav bar which is visible to logged in users.  
 - Johnny Kingi, who worked on the view bookings and interactions pages.  
 - Jillian Eccles, who worked on the client history page.  
 - Cody Ludwig, who worked on the admin functions page.  
 - Basant Singh, who was in charge of testing all our pages and organising the paperwork required as part of the project.  
 
 The project is entirely web based, using AJAX and PHP with a MySQL server to store the data. A web server is required to host the database to run this project. During development we used MAMP on our local machines. The connection string in connect.php will need to be altered to point to the address of the database to run it elsewhere.
